Crime Statistics – R Script
This R script automates the processing and visualization of crime statistics provided by the French government. It generates relevant graphs and summary tables to facilitate analysis.

The data is categorized into four distinct territorial zones:

- Paris
- Île-de-France (excluding Paris)
- Mainland France
- Overseas territories

The script is designed to streamline the analysis process and can be easily adapted for similar datasets.
